There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  Smartfolio

## Sub-Heading ##
  Photo Archiving App that preserves the picture album and notes for future generations.

## Summary ##
  We all know someone in the family who is keeping the picture albums. We all enjoy looking through those albums and flipping the pictures over to see the notes and history of that picture. Smartfolio allows you to combine the treasure of the photos (front AND back) as you digitize them for future generations. Added features like the using IBM Watson's artificial intelligence features analyze your images and provide suggested tags for indexing. Just imagine when you can assemble new albums based on who is in the pictures or find all the images that are related to birthdays. You can even enhance the album viewing experience by hearing music selected based on image content, and by giving your friends access to the albums you've created.

## Problem ##
  There are a lot of photo archiving apps out there, but none of them allow you to link the front and back of a picture.

## Solution ##
  Smartfolio allows you to add scanned or saved jpeg files in a front/back format. Optionally, if you don't want to add an image back, you have a freeform text field where you can add a description of your image and capture memories for generations to come.

## Quote from You ##
  "Finally there is a way to really save for posterity all those photos you've been collecting."

## How to Get Started ##
  Scan your images to jpeg files, and then go to our website where you can set up an account in seconds and start saving.

## Customer Quote ##
  "Why hasn't anyone thought of this before? Using Smartfolio to store all my family's memories is so much better than the boxes of photos in the basement that nobody looks at."
